# ts-db-sandbox
TypeScript Database sandbox with Node.js

I followed instructions on MongoDB to try my hand at setting up a backend. 
I used this repo: https://github.com/mongodb-developer/mongodb-typescript-example/blob/finish/src/routes/games.router.ts
and this article: https://www.mongodb.com/compatibility/using-typescript-with-mongodb-tutorial
to follow along and learn about connecting to a cloud database with a Typescript app. I want to be able to do this with my football repo.
Most (if not all) code in this <ts-db-sandbox> repo was written by MongoDB. From there, I will be messing with it in order to learn enough to create a database for my football repo.
